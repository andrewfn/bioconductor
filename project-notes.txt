all.cells 

-acgtcgaattac = represent barcodes for each single cell (ie. 1 column is a single cell)
-each row = is a gene
-each entry (ie. o, 22, 5) = the counts for that gene in a single cell
-column 1 (ie. 0610005C13Rik) = gene name, identifier. 

#. We will be working with only first 1000 genes due to limitations in computer ability to process data
#. remove any genes that are low abundance genes by removing any gene that was fund in less than 3 cells.
#. Remove any genes that are not part of a list of genes of interest
#. Run other processes
#. Generate heat map
